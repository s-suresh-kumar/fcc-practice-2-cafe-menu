/* Step 18
The text is centered again so the link to the CSS file is working. Add another style to the file that changes the background-color property to brown for the body element. */
body {
  /* Step 19
  That brown background makes it hard to read the text. Change the body element's background color to be burlywood so it has some color but you are still be able to read the text. */
  background-color: burlywood;
}
/* Step 14
You have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the style tags. This works, but since there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.

We have created a separate styles.css file for you and switched the editor view to that file. You can change between files with the tabs at the top of the editor.

Start by rewriting the styles you have created into the styles.css file. Make sure to exclude the opening and closing style tags. */
/* Step 21
The goal now is to make the div not take up the entire width of the page. The CSS width property is perfect for this. Create a new type selector in the style sheet that gives your div element a width of 300px. */
div {
  width: 300px;
}
h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
