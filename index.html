<!-- Step 1
As you learned in the last few steps of the Cat Photo App, there is a basic structure needed to start building your web page.

Add the <!DOCTYPE html> tag, and an html element with a lang attribute of en. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"></html>
Step 2
<!-- Add a head element within the html element, so you can add a title element. The title element's text should be Cafe Menu. -->
<head>
  <title>Cafe Menu</title>
</head>
