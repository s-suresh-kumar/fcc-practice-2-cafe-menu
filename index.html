<!-- Step 1
As you learned in the last few steps of the Cat Photo App, there is a basic structure needed to start building your web page.

Add the <!DOCTYPE html> tag, and an html element with a lang attribute of en. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

</html>
<!-- Step 2
Add a head element within the html element, so you can add a title element. The title element's text should be Cafe Menu. -->

<head>
  <title>Cafe Menu</title>
  <!-- Step 3
The title is one of several elements that provide extra information not visible on the web page, but it is useful for search engines or how the page gets displayed.

Inside the head element, nest a meta element with an attribute named charset set to the value utf-8 to tell the browser how to encode characters for the page. Note that meta elements are self-closing. -->
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <!-- Step 17
For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute.

Add the following within the head element:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-s -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

  <!-- 
    Step 13
You now have three type selectors with the exact same styling. You can add the same group of styles to many elements by creating a list of selectors. Each selector is separated with commas like this:

selector1, selector2 {
  property: value;
}
Delete the three existing type selectors and replace them with one selector list that centers the text for the h1, h2, and p elements.  -->

  <!-- Step 14
You have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the style tags. This works, but since there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.

We have created a separate styles.css file for you and switched the editor view to that file. You can change between files with the tabs at the top of the editor.

Start by rewriting the styles you have created into the styles.css file. Make sure to exclude the opening and closing style tags. -->
  <!-- Step 15
Now that you have the CSS in the styles.css file, go ahead and remove the style element and all its content. Once it is removed, the text that was centered will shift back to the left. -->
  <!-- Step 16
Now you need to link the styles.css file so the styles will be applied again. Nest a self-closing link element in the head element. Give it a rel attribute value stylesheet and an href attribute value of styles.css. -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<!-- Step 4 -->
<!-- To prepare to create some actual content, add a body element below the head element. -->

<body>
  <!-- Step 20
The div element is used mainly for design layout purposes unlike the other content elements you have used so far. Add a div element inside the body element and then move all the other elements inside the new div. -->
  <!-- Step 27
To apply the class's styling to the div element, add a class attribute to the div element's opening tag and set its value to menu. -->
  <div class="menu">
    <!-- Step 5 -->
    <!-- It's time to add some menu content. Add a main element within the existing body element. It will eventually contain pricing information about coffee and desserts offered by the cafe. -->
    <main>
      <!-- Step 7 -->
      <!-- To let visitors know the cafe was founded in 2020, add a p element below the h1 element with the text Est. 2020. -->
      <h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>
      <p>Est. 2020</p>
      <!-- Step 8 -->
      <!-- There will be two sections on the menu, one for coffees and one for desserts. Add a section element within the main element so you have a place to put all the coffees available. -->
      <section>
        <!-- Step 9
Create an h2 element in the section element and give it the text Coffee. -->

        <h2>Coffee</h2>
        <!-- Step 10
  Up until now, you have been limited regarding the presentation and appearance of the content you create. To start taking control, add a style element within the head element. -->

        <!-- Step 11
  You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:
  
  element {
   property: value;
  }
  Center your h1 element by setting its text-align property to the value center. -->
        <!-- Step 12
  In the previous step, you used a type selector to style the h1 element. Center the h2 and p elements by adding a new type selector for each one to the existing style element. -->
        <!-- Step 29
  Itâ€™s looking good. Time to start adding some menu items. Add an empty article element under the Coffee heading. It will contain a flavor and price of each coffee you currently offer.   -->
        <!-- Step 30
article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information. In this case, it will contain a coffee flavor and a price for that flavor. Nest two p elements inside your article element. The first one's text should be French Vanilla, and the second's text 3.00. -->

        <!-- Step 34
Next, you want to align the price to the right. Add a class named price to your p element that has 3.00 as its text. -->

        <!-- Step 36
That is kind of what you want, but now it would be nice if the flavor and price were on the same line. p elements are block-level elements, so they take up the entire width of their parent element.

To get them on the same line, you need to apply some styling to the p elements, so they behave more like inline elements. Add a class attribute with the value item to the first article element under the Coffee heading. -->

        <!-- Step 40
That worked, but there is still a little space on the right of the price.

You could keep trying various percentages for the widths. Instead, use the back space key on your keyboard to move the p element with the class price next to the p element with the class flavor so that they are on the same line in the editor. Make sure there is no space between them. -->

        <article class="item">
          <p class="flavor">French Vanilla</p><p class="price">3.00</p>
        </article>

        <!-- Step 31
        Starting below the existing coffee/price pair, add the following coffee and prices using article elements with two nested p elements inside each. As before, the first p element's text should contain the coffee flavor and the second p element's text should contain the price.
        
        Caramel Macchiato 3.75
        Pumpkin Spice 3.50
        Hazelnut 4.00
        Mocha 4.50 -->

        <!-- Step 32
The flavors and prices are currently stacked on top of each other and centered with their respective p elements. It would be nice if the flavor was on the left and the price was on the right.

Add the class name flavor to the French Vanilla p element. -->

        <!-- Step 42
Now that you know it works, you can change the remaining article and p elements to match the first set. Start by adding the class item to the other article elements. -->

        <!-- Step 43
Next, position the other p elements to be on the same line with no space between them. -->

        <!-- Step 44
To complete the styling, add the applicable class names flavor and price to all the remaining p elements. -->

        <article class="item">
          <p class="flavor">Caramel Macchiato</p><p class="price">3.75</p>
        </article>

        <article class="item">
          <p class="flavor">Pumpkin Spice</p>
          <p class="price">3.50</p>
        </article>

        <article class="item">
          <p class="flavor">Hazelnut</p><p class="price">4.00</p>
        </article>

        <article class="item">
          <p class="flavor">Mocha</p><p class="price">4.50</p>
        </article>

      </section>

      <!-- Step 46
You will come back to styling the menu in a few steps, but for now, go ahead and add a second section element below the first for displaying the desserts offered by the cafe. -->

      <section>

        <!-- Step 47
Add an h2 element in the new section and give it the text Desserts. -->

        <h2>Desserts</h2>

        <!-- Step 48
        Add an empty article element under the Desserts heading. Give it a class attribute with the value item. -->

        <article class="item">

          <!-- Step 49
          Nest two p elements inside your article element. The first one's text should be Donut, and the second's text 1.50. Put both of them on the same line making sure there is no space between them. -->

          <!-- Step 50
          For the two p elements you just added, add dessert as the value of the first p element's class attribute and the value price as the second p elements class attribute. -->

          <p class="dessert">Donut</p><p class="price">1.50</p>



        </article>

        <!-- Step 52
        Below the dessert you just added, add the rest of the desserts and prices using three more article elements, each with two nested p elements. Each element should have the correct dessert and price text, and all of them should have the correct classes.
